## Software Crisis

Difficulty in writing useful and efficient program in time.

### Causes

- Over Budget
- Over Time
- Low Quality
- Inefficient
- Unmet Requirements

## Changing Nature of Software

### Broad Categories

1. **System:** Service other programs.
2. **Application:** End Users
3. **Engineering/Scientific:** Engineering tasks
4. **Embedded:** Resides in ROM, control consumer/industrial products.
5. **Product Line:**
6. **Web App:** Client Server program, runs in browser.
7. **Artificial Intelligence Software:** Programs that use algos that learn by example. Uses structure close to human brain.

## Software Quality

Quality product does everything according to user.

### Factors
