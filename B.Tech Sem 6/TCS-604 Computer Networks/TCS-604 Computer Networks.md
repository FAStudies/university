## Transmission Control Protocol

Transmission Control Protocol is a connection oriented, reliable protocol. TCP explicitly defines connection establishment, data transfer and connection teardown phases to provide a connection oriented service.

### TCP Congestion

Congestion refers to the network state where the message traffic becomes so heavy that it slows down the network response time. Congestion leads to loss of packets in transit.

- Congestion is an important issue that can arise in **Packet Switched Network**.
- Congestion leads to the loss of packets in transit.
- So, it is necessary to control the congestion in network.
- It is not possible to completely avoid the congestion.
