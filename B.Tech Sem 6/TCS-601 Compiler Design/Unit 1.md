# Compiler

- A compiler is a program that can read a program in one language (Source Language) and
  translate it into an equivalent program in another language (Target Language).
- An important role of compiler is to report any error in any program that it deduces
  during translation process.
- Traditionally, compilers go from high level language to low level language.

# Interpreter

- Another kind of language processor, it also takes in source code, but instead of producing a target program as a translation, an interpreter appears to directly execute the operations specified in the source program on inputs supplied by the user.

# What do compilers do?

Compilers generate three types of code:

## Pure Machine Code

Machine instruction set without assuming the existence of any operating system or library, mostly being OS or embedded applications.

## Augmented Machine Code

Code with OS routines and runtime support routines.

## Virtual Machine Code

Virtual Instructions can be run on any architecture with a virtual machine interpreter.  
**Example:** Java

# Types of Compiler

## Native Code Compiler

The compiler used to compile a source code for same type of platform only. The output generated by this type of compiler can only be run on the same type of computer system and OS that the compiler itself runs on.

## Cross Compiler
