## Categories of Data

- Structured
- Unstructured
- Semistructured

### Structured Data

In structured data, the data is stored in form of tables, and can be operated on using Query Languages.

### Unstructured Data

There are many types of unstructured data, such as documents, photos, audio files, messages, etc. combine together to form unstructured data.

### Semistructured Data

This type of data lies between structured and semi-structured data. This type of data follows strict structure, but cannot be operated upon using query language. Example: Source Code, JSON files, etc.

## Use of Data in Machine Learning

Machine learning uses these data for:

- Descriptive Analysis
- Predictive Analysis
- Perspective Analysis

Unstructured and Semistructured data needs to be transformed into Structured form before performing these analysis. This comes under preprocessing stage.

### Descriptive Analysis

**Example:** Company Dashboard (PowerBI), Visualisations (Tableu), etc.

### Predictive Analysis

**Example:** Predicting future profits based on changing pricing, predicting credit card fraud.

# Prescriptive Analysis
**Example:** YouTube Recommendations, Amazon similar items, twitter interested topics, etc.
