    "### Goals of ML?\n",
    "- To make computers intellegent. (To develop system for specific practical learning in application domain. \n",
    "- To develop computational model of human learning process and perform computer simulations. \n",
    "- To explote new learning methods and develop general learning algorithm independent of application. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why these goals are important?\n",
    "- Today we need to make computers intellegent as present day applications require huge amount of complex knowledge and data in programs and tremendous amount of work. Main bottleneck is to give an expert system the knowledge of experts.\n",
    "- If we understand human learning process, we may be able to overcome our disability in learning something or some task that seems difficult. It will lead to discovery of more efficient education techniques. \n",
    "- To create tools that are fit for multiple uses. "
