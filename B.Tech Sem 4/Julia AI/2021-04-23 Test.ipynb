    "The Dummy variable trap is a scenario where there are attributes which are highly correlated (Multicollinear) and one variable predicts the value of others. When we use one hot encoding for handling the categorical data, then one dummy variable (attribute) can be predicted with the help of other dummy variables. Hence, one dummy variable is highly correlated with other dummy variables. Using all dummy variables for regression models lead to dummy variable trap. So, the regression models should be designed excluding one dummy variable."

    "- It offers a faster runtime performance. It uses the LLVM framework for just-in-time compilation (JIT). Thanks to this approach, Julia can offer the same speed as C.\n",
    "- Julia can work directly with various external libraries. For example, you can use the PyCall library to interface with code written in Python, and even exchange data between Julia and Python.\n",
